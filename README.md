# IU-DSA-SPRING-2025

By the end of the course, the general expectation is that you are able to
1. describe what algorithm analysis is
2. recall the common trade-offs when choosing an algorithm or a data structure
3. apply algorithm analysis techniques to a given algorithm
(i.e. write a mathematical proof)
4. recall elements of proofs for known algorithms
5. apply a known* algorithm or data structure operations to input data
6. recall and apply a known algorithm to solve a given problem
7. implement algorithms and data structures in Java or C++
